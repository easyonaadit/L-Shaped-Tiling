L Shaped Tiling: 
Given a grid of dimentions 2^n by 2^n, and the coordinates of one grid square blacked out, tile the rest of the plane with L-Shaped tiles, of area 3 unit squared and length = breath = 1.
The code solves the problem by exploiitng a recursive sub structure in the algorithm.
Execute the alt.c file for the actual implementation.
